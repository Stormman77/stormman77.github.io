# 3D Printing - Fabricating for a Function part 2 (Journal Entry 10)

**OVERVIEW**

This journal entry is a brief blog post where I'll discuss the process of designing my idea from journal entry 8 - a charger stand for my apple watch. I want to begin with a confession - I lied in the Fusion assignment. After completing it and having troubles with the flask and bowler hat, I wrote that I would be doing my final project in Freecad. However, I decided to give Fusion another try, and I think it was worth it - deisgning this project was really smooth and rather enjoyable.

**PLANNING**

After choosing to create a charging stand for my watch, I had to actually design it. I didn't want to create a simple shape, and after some thinking I started googling for inspiration. Out of all apple watch stand ideas I saw - hands, cats, guns, 3-in-1 stands (for the watch, phone and earphones) - my favorite one was someting with a retro tv or computer. Here are some of them: 

* [Old TV](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/various/apple-watch-tv-charger-stand-series-5-44-mm)
* [Old computer](https://www.printables.com/model/265964-apple-watch-s7-macintosh-128k-charging-stand)

Therefore, I decided to create a stand that would make my watch screen look like a tv screen

**TAKING MEASUREMENTS**

Before starting with Fusion, I had to take the measurements of my watch and the charger. Some of the measurements I took myself using calipers from the Innovation Hub, and other I took from google. Here they are:

Apple Watch SE 2022 44mm / regular apple watch charger

**DESIGNING**

As I already said, I decided to start the project in Fusion. I quickly realized that the whole thing could be done using just one cube and adding/cutting out shapes on it using sketches. 
Using the dimensions, I created a main box of 55x30x55mm (I later extruded the box by 7 mm in length and 5 mm down to get some space for decorative buttons on the side). Then, my plan consisted of 4 steps:

* 1 - create a circular hole for the charger in the center of the box on the back plane (it can go through the whole box because there will be an even bigger screen on the other side)
* 2 - create a rounded rectangular hole for the screen on the front plane (the screen only extruded into the box up to the middle, because there would be a cutout for the watch itself on the top)
* 3 - create a cutout for the watch and the belt on the top plane
* 4 - add decorations

*STEP 1*

On the sketch, I simply created a circle 27 mm in diameter (which turned out to be a mistake - the charger is also 27 mm in diameter, and I should've made the cutout for it bigger), and a little tunnel for the cord:

*STEP 2*

To create the screen, I also simply created a rectangle in the center using the dimensions of the screen on my watch, and used fillet on the edges to copy the shape of the watch:

^The screen and charger cutouts are off-centered because I made screenshots after I finished the project*

*STEP 3*

Step 3 actually required some calculations and measurements, but overall was easy, and I think the screenshot makes it self-explanatory:

^Lines extend beyond the body on the right because I made the box longer, but it doesn't show up on the sketch

*STEP 4*

After finishing the main part, I decided to add some decorative parts. As I said beforem, to make space for them, I extended the body to the right and down. To the right of the screen, I decided to make some knobs, and under the screen I placed a speaker. I couldn't figure out how to do a mesh in fusion, and had to make the speaker manually (it was painful, but I survived):

**CONCLUSION**

Surprisingly, I finished designing my project pretty quickly, and I got used to designing simple things like my tv watch stand using simple geometric shapes and sketches on different planes, as well as some features in the fusion. Now I can safely say that I 100% like Fusion more than Freecad.

Here is the some final screenshots of my design:
