## First journal entry

**Hello Everyone!**

My name is Alex(ey) Cherepanov, and this is my first journal entry for this class.

For this post, I just want to share some important details about myself:

- I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science
- I love programming, racing, travelling and playing board games
- I am 19 years old
- I have a princess
- My favorite color is green but I’m not really sure (still like 85% sure) about that
- I've never had a dog, but I had 3 hamsters
- I love watching formula 1
- I am officially 6’1″
- I'm ok with eating broccoli
- Before I die, I wanna go to Burning Man

I’m taking this class primarily to fulfill 8 of the state requirements, but also because people write that von Hollen is hilarious and a top G on RMP:

I’m looking forward to learning a lot of new things in this class. Thank you!
