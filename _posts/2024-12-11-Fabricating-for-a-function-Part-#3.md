# 3D Printing - Fabricating for a Function part 3 (Journal Entry 12)

**OVERVIEW**

Here it is - the last journal entry for this class. I'm actually kinda sad beacuse I relly like IDS - every single lecture was hilarious yet informative and useful, and the projects were interesting and engaging. This is probably the first class with mandatory attendance policy that I didn't hate.

In this journal entry, I'm going to write about printing my desing from part 2, as well as describing some troubles I've run into and posting a final video.

**PRINTING**

I finished designing my project quite early, somewhere around Friday, and wanted to send it to printing right away in order to be done with the project before the finals week. However, I couldn't really figure out how 3dprinteros website worked. I tried uploading my model in .f3d and .3mf formats, but neither one had the option of slicing or printing. Thereofre, I had to wait until Monday to come to the Hub and ask someone how to send my model to printing in person. 

Fast forwarding to Monday, it turned out that I was supposed to save my model as mesh and only then send it to 3dprinteros. I didn't change default printing settings, and all the needed supports were created automatically, so I just had to wait for about 2 hours for my model to be done.

After getting my model and removing all the supports, I found out that the cutout for the charger was too small. The charger itself had a diameter of 27mm, and the cutout also was exactly 27mm, and I really should've made it bigger. I started sanding it down, which took me another hour, and I also damaged the front panel by accident, but after all I managed to fit the charger in the cutout:
