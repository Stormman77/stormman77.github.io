## Third journal entry

**Teamwork**

For this journal entry, I'm writing about the teamwork in our team (2D). We met at the library to brainstorm possible ideas for our future app project, and we already have a couple of cool and totally not goofy app ideas in our minds. We also figured out how all 4 of us can work on the project at the same time from different laptops (kinda), and we also created a draft for the login page of our cool and totally not goofy app:

Also, here is a selfie that we just took as a proof that we actually had a meeting at Strozier:
