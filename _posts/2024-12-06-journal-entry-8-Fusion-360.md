# 3D Modeling - Fusion 360 (Journal Entry 8)

**OVERVIEW**

For this jpurnal entry we will be taking a journey into the world of Autodesk Fusion 360. We created four models, which gave us a basic understanding of the program and its features. In this blog I'm going to present and briefly explain the process of creating the models, as well as a brief comparison between Fusion, Freecad, and Tinkercad.

**Model 1: Tutorial shape**

Super straightforward, nothing interesting to describe here:

**Model 2: Lampshade**

This one introduced us to the concept of using squiggles and revolve. Also nothing hard, to be honest, so here's my lampshade and the squiggle I used to create it:

**Model 3: The flask YET AGAIN!**

Yes, yes, the one and only flask model is back! I kinda missed it since we were doing Tinkercad. We also saw someone's rendered flask made in fusion, and it looked fantastic, so I was excited for this one... (It took me three hours to finish this one).

First of all, I found a picture of a flat-bottomed flask on the Internet and used it to create the outlines in fusion to then revolve it and get the flask. The flask itself turned out really good and perfectly shaped, but I couldn't figure out how to "fill" it with water. For some reason, I thought that fusion could simulate liquids that I would be able to pour inside the flask - I even turned on a trial subscription to get access to simulations:

Then I did something similar to how we created "liquid" inside the flask in tinkercad - on the sketch, I cut the top of the flask off, creating the second body inside the glass flask. However, when trying to render it, it ended up not nearly close to my expectations:

^RIP my poor i5

^I tried to play with lighting settings, but nothing really worked :(

I'd like to note that I'm trying to make this blog short, when in fact it really took me a lot of time to solve every single issue I was running into at almost every step. Anyway, I thought that the reason why the renders were incorrect was because the inner "liquid" body was intercepting with the glass walls somewhere. I went back to the sketch and changed it in a way so that the inner body did not touch the walls, and this was the solution:

**Model 4: Return of the bowler hat**

For the fourth model, we again are coming back the bowler hat - a model that took me about 40 seconds to finish in Tinkercad. To be honest, I didn't really know where to start in Fusion, and after some time spent on trying to get at least somewhere, I started googling. I found a tutorial on YouTube from 2013 which had horrible quality and was sped up for some reason, but the author of the tutorial was creating the exact bowler hat from the requirements, except that his hat was round, which I easily changed by making it oval. Here's the [link to that tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjC5tX4Fgz8). With the help of the tutorial, I got this shape:

Even though the tutorial was pretty good, I eventually ran into a problem - I could not make the hat void inside: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d059bb54-7e8e-42bd-aaa3-2e0f7b289345)

In the tutorial, author was using a "convert" feature on two bodies - the top part and the brim - to be able to choose the cutout for the head and delete it. When I tried to do the same, I found out that the "convert" feature was not working as in the tutorial (in fact, I didn't even see anything change when using it - in the tutorial, "convert" feature create dublicates of the bodies). Whether it is because I used it incorrectly, or because the feature got updated 11 years after the tutorial release - I honestly have no clue. Therefore, my bowler hat has a really nice shape (in my humble opinion), but it does not have the cutout for the head (technically it is void inside, but the cutout was closed in the process of creating the brims). Here are the renders:

**Conclusion**

Before starting this assignment, I (for some reason) was sure that fusion would be easier to use than freecad. I can now tell that for me, personally, fusion was much more complex, which not only didn't help but actually made creating such easy models as flask and bowler hat really challenging. I still think that Fusion is a much more advanced tool that gives you many more opportunities than freecad, but only when you know how to use it. I can also surely say that 5 days before finals week were not nearly enough to learn any features of fusion. Also, after completing this assignment, I think that I will be designing the second part of the "fubricating for a function" in freecad, not in fusion.
