# 3D Modeling in Tinkercad

**OVERVIEW**

For this journal entry, I'm writing about the chapter in my life called "3D modeling with tinkercad". It included 7 levels, and was one of a journey - some levels were easy, and some made me lose some hair. Here I'm going to write about every single level with screenshots and explanations of struggles that I faced with each one of them.

##LVL 1 - PVC pipe cross joint

Link [Here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ePiRqHCUURW-idslvl1)

Since this is the first level, I kinda expected it to be trivial, and so it was. The whole project consists of 4 details - 2 white cylinders and 2 more void cylinders. Nothing hard, nothing fancy:

**LVL 2 - Egg**

This one also could've been done with just 4 shapes - two half spheres and two more void half spheres. However, I decided to add a small detail - a connecting piece between the top and bottom parts of the egg:

**LVL 3 - Floppy disk**

Link [Here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hXrdIvvWgkA-idslvl3)

This level was a bit harder - floppy disk has more details and requires more shapes. The blue base was created with a smushed box with cutouts in the edges. The metal sliding thing that protects the disk was also made from a smushed box with rounded edges. The white tag was made like the metal disk protection, but consisted of two white cubes because it was of a different size on the front and back of the floppy disk. The round metallic disk center was made of a cylinder with two rounded rectangle cutouts. I also added the text on the white tag using the built-in text feature. The most challenging part of this level was probably to align the metallic disk protection and paper tag and make them with an "overflowing" effect, but the level still was pretty easy and was done in 10 minutes.

**LVL 4 - Spoon / Fork**

Link [Here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/2HFdSYj7rYI-idslvl4)

For this level, our class was given a choice between creating a plastic spoon or fork. Despite me and some other people trying to explain that the curvature of the spoon would be harder to create, our class still chose to go for it. To be honest, I pretty much enjoyed all levels but this one. First, I struggled with creating the handle even though it was supposed to be the easiest part of the level. Then I struggled even more with the spoon part itself, and connecting it to the handle in particular. If you look at my spoon, you'll see that there are two parts of the spoon-handle connection that are missing, and I'm honestly not sure how I can fix it. I decided to leave it as it is and save some time for writing a bit more about this level, as well as working on the aviator sunglasses.

^ And this is how I tried to make it work
I probably should've just used the "egg" shape for the spoon part and not worry about the cutouts on the sides, but again, I was really stuck and decided to spend more time on the journal and level 7.

**LVL 5 - Flask**

Link [Here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/gfiMIFpb9Mr-idslvl5)

This level we completed in class, and overall it was a pretty easy one. However it is worth mentioning that I learned two useful things that I was using in the next levels - transparency and an alignment tool. The flask basically consisted of the flat-bottomed sphere, a cylinder, two cones and a torus on top. To make the flask void, we just used the copy of the same flask, made it a bit smaller, and aligned it in the center inside the original flask. To simulate the liquid, we also used pretty much the same smaller copy of the flask, but without the top part. I made three flasks - two with liquids with different colors, and I also put one of them on a little table that only consisted of four cylinders and a cube.

##LVL 6 - Bowler hat

When I saw the bowler hat that we had to create for this level, I first thought that it would be even more difficult than the spoon. However, it happened to be a pretty easy level and we basically made it in class in a couple of minutes. The hat consists of a cylinder that's a little bit elongated, a half sphere on top, and a torus for the brim. In order to make the brim a right form, we used a void torus, that was a bit longer than the first torus.

##LVL 7 - Aviator sunglasses

Link [Here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/h1sGev73BrJ-idslvl7)

This is the hardest level, but I was kinda excited to work on it, maybe because I love aviator sunglasses. From the beginning it was obvious that the hardest part would be to create the right curvature to the lenses and the frame. My plan was to create the lenses, then the frame around the lenses is the same shape and can be made by copying and changing the size of the lense; after that I would create the hinges, temples, and temple tips; finally, I would create small details like the nose pads and the bridge between the lenses.

**Creating the lenses**

To create the right shape of the glasses, I used different shapes like cylinders and cubes. I also had to use roof shapes to fill some spaces in between the forms:

After that, I copied and mirrored the lense to create the second one, and used another pair of lenses that I upscaled and adjusted to be around the main lenses, therefore creating the freame. Then I used giant spheres to create a slight curvature (can be seen from the top of the finished sunglasses):

**Hinges, temples, and temple tips**

Then I created the hinges, small screws, temples and temple tips:

**Small details**

Finally, I created small details as nose mounts and bridge between the lenses:

**LVL 8 - Bonus**
This is the project I found in my tinkercad account back from 2017:
