## 3D Modeling in Tinkercad

**OVERVIEW**

For this journal entry, I'm writing about the chapter in my life called "3D modeling with tinkercad". It included 7 levels, and was one of a journey - some levels were easy, and some made me lose some hair. Here I'm going to write about every single level with screenshots and explanations of struggles that I faced with each one of them.

**LVL 1 - PVC pipe cross joint**

Since this is the first level, I kinda expected it to be trivial, and so it was. The whole project consists of 4 details - 2 white cylinders and 2 more void cylinders. Nothing hard, nothing fancy:

**LVL 2 - Egg**

This one also could've been done with just 4 shapes - two half spheres and two more void half spheres. However, I decided to add a small detail - a connecting piece between the top and bottom parts of the egg:

**LVL 3 - Floppy disk**

This level was a bit harder - floppy disk has more details and requires more shapes. The blue base was created with a smushed box with cutouts in the edges. The metal sliding thing that protects the disk was also made from a smushed box with rounded edges. The white tag was made like the metal disk protection, but consisted of two white cubes because it was of a different size on the front and back of the floppy disk. The round metallic disk center was made of a cylinder with two rounded rectangle cutouts. I also added the text on the white tag using the built-in text feature. The most challenging part of this level was probably to align the metallic disk protection and paper tag and make them with an "overflowing" effect, but the level still was pretty easy and was done in 10 minutes.
