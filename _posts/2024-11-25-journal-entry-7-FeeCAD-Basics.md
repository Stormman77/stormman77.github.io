# FreeCAD Basics

**OVERVIEW**

For this journal entry we are working with a software called FreeCad. As soon as I saw the app for the first time, I instantly realized two things:

1. FreeCAD is much more complex than Tinkercad
2. FreeCAD seems much more interesting than Tinkercad, and I will enjoy working with it more

After completing this assignment, I can definitely say that only one of those things happened to be true. (it's not the second one)

**OBJECT 1 - basic part tutorial**

For the first object, we just had to complete the tutorial from the internet. The tutorial was quite good - even though there were some button and feature names that were different from the actual names in the app, the tutorial was super detailed and if you follow each step carefully, there's little to no chance for you to mess it up. This object took me about 20 minutes to finish, and overall was nice and smooth to build. Pretty much the only problem I faced in the process was at the very last step, when I was trying to change the refine property for the pocket to hide the intersection lines of the blocks. For some reason, it didn't work. Probably I was trying to change the refine property on a wrong feature, but anyways, here is my first object:

**OBJECT 2 - desk cord clip**

The second object we need to create for this assignment is a clip that attaches to the desk edge and holds the charging cable for laptop or anything else. This object is a bit more complicated than the first one simply because there is no tutorial to follow - I need to design, measure, and create the object by myself. According to the requirements, we can't glue or screw the object into the table - it has to hold itself on the edge of the desk with nothing but physics. Before I start this object, I need to measure my charging cable and the desk.
