# 3D Printing - Fabricating for a Function part 1 (Journal Entry 9)

**OVERVIEW**

This is the first of three journal entries related to the 3D printing project for our class. This time, we have to find an issue/problem that can be solved or fixed with 3D printing, design and create the solution, and present it. The first part is finding and talking about the problem that I'm going to solve. As I mentioned many, many times before, the hardest part of such projects for me is getting inspiration, and this time was no different. I went home for the Thanksgiving break and I promise you that I was thinking about problems I could solve with 3D printing every single day, and I only found something on Sunday, the day before the deadline.  

Therefore, I proudly present you my idea - I will create a charging stand for my apple watch! It has a special mode (I think it's called the nightstand mode or alarm mode or something like that) so that when it's connected to the charger, it displays time and notifications and basically works as a nightstand clock. Sometimes I use it when I'm working on my desk, and it's convenient because you can always see what time it is. However, my apple watch isn't always stable when sitting on the desk, and the charging cord makes it look worse. I want to try to create a stand to support the watch itself but also somehow hide the charging cord. I also want to mention that I saw those apple watch stands on the Internet, but never really wanted to spend money on one of those.
